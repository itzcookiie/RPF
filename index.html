                        "On that day [when that time comes] you will know for yourselves that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you. 21 The person who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him [I will make Myself real to him].” 22 Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?”"

Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.

        <h1>About the church</h1>
        <p>The sent leader of this House is Pastor Austin E-Ben. He is a man who is fully reliant on the Holy Spirit. After giving his life to Christ, he jumped into the work of ministry. In a short time, he had served as a Youth Pastor, Teen Pastor and Assistant Pastor with a complete dedication to God and His work. Fully consecrated to God, he was trained under several leaders till late 2013. It was at this time he met his spiritual father; Bishop Adol-Paul Obinwaogu, who God used to commission him into ministry.</p>
        <h1>Church history</h1>
        <p>In the Summer of 2014, a Bible study meeting started at St Giles Parish Hall, and on Sunday 26th October of the same year, the Sunday services began. Since then, God has strengthened and increased His work through His servant. Ever since God sent His servant, God has always been with the Church and the Power of God has been present from the very first day.
