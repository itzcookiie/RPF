        <h1>About the church</h1>
        <p>Redeemed Pillar of Fire Church, also known as RPF, is an End time church preparing men and women of God for the last outpouring of His Spirit upon the church. We are family-orientated church that seeks to support its members in every area to have a prosperous life, fulfil their callings and walk as well as hear from the spirit. This church is called to be like the early church of the apostles rooted in Acts 2: 43-47. 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 44 Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, 45 and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.<br><br>

            46 So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, 47 praising God and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.<br><br>

            From praise and worship to warfare prayers, every soul is nurtured in all areas of Godly Spirituality so that they are ready and equipped for the tribulations of the end times. The only aim is Heaven and the only way to get there is through Holiness and righteousness. Please come and join us on the journey of knowing Jesus Christ by attending any of our services or contacting us via telephone or our social media platforms.</p>
        <h1>Church history</h1>
        <p>
            Pastor Austin, the sent leader of the house, was led into ministry after meeting his Spiritual Father Bishop Adol-Paul Obinwaogu in the Autumn of 2013. In 2014, what started as weekly bible study sessions on Fridays, led to the official opening of the church on the 26th of October 2014. The Lord has been with the ministry ever since and has taken us on a journey of knowing not just His acts but also His ways. As the power of God began to flow in 2015, the Lord began to teach us the foundational principles of His ministry from service structure, to administering deliverance. This year equipped us with the spiritual knowledge to tend to the incoming souls.

            2016 saw the church grow to a new level where the Lord began to show us glimpses of His glory as the altar of prayer was lifted. The manifestations of His power were evident from deep foundational deliverance to seeing the glory cloud of God dewing in the atmosphere. Many things about prayer were taught to us to truly establish us as the prayer mission we are today.

            2017 is where God knitted us together in his love and solidified the ties of family and friendship amongst us. Here, we learnt how to support one another to strive towards holiness not just as fellow church members but brothers and sisters in Christ. The Lord increased the church and reaffirmed the importance of communion and fellowship not just with ourselves but also the precious Holy Spirit. The Lord appeared to Pastor Austin and spoke of 2020 being the year of uplifting for the ministry. This saw a great shift in the direction and speed of the ministry as we geared ourselves to what the Lord had spoken.

            2018 saw a massive influx of souls as radical evangelism took place. Location to Location and door to door the word was spread far and wide to a point God led His children through dreams to His house. The gifts of God in began to manifest through everyone and deeper realms of knowing God were unlocked through dreams, visions, prayer and various encounters. We learnt the power of being the secret place and the depth of God available to us if we just yield.

            2019 was a year of great endurance and tarrying in the presence of God This year was packed with fasting from beginning to end as we waited on God for the manifestation of His promise in souls and the outpouring of His latter rain upon the house. Every member was equipped in the word and prayer to enter the year prophesied about with POWER!

            Now, in the year of 2020 with the unexpected global pandemic, the church took to virtual evangelism and services. A radical outpouring of teaching and the word and sharing was sent forth to prepare for the influx of souls and the glory of God as revival breaks forth.
